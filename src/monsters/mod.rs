//! Monster family module — registry and definitions for DDGC monster families.
//!
//! This module provides the family-aware view of DDGC monsters, where each
//! enemy is represented as a `MonsterFamily` with role, type, dungeon,
//! behavior profile, and associated skill IDs.
//!
//! The `families` submodule contains the registry with lookup by family ID
//! for archetype, role, skill-pack, and behavior-profile.
